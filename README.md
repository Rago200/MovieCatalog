# MovieCatalog
Designed and Implemented a binary search tree to store movies based on rating, year, and name.

# Functionality
The user can add movies, lookup movies and find the best movies. The compare to method prioratized year then rating 
then name when it came to sorting the catalog. The to string method used an in order traversal to print the catalog. There were three main objects used: the movie tree, movies and nodes. The movie tree emulated the structure of a Binary Search Tree while the nodes that were added were movies.
